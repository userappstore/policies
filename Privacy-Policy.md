## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At UserAppStore we have a few fundamental principles:

*   We don't ask you for personal information until you install commercial apps or wish to become a publisher.
*   We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
*   We don't share your projects unless you publish them on our appstore.

Your personal data can be deleted using an activate, wait and confirm two step process.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, UserAppStore collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. UserAppStore's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how UserAppStore's visitors use its website. From time to time, UserAppStore may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

UserAppStore also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors choose to interact with UserAppStore in ways that require gathering personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that UserAppStore gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users who wish to install commercial apps to provide billing information including name, contact email and address.  All appstore publishers must submit their name, age, address and other personal information and business information.  Within Europe registered business publishers may also be required to provide name and address and personal information of certain company shareholders.

### Aggregated Statistics

UserAppStore may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, UserAppStore may monitor the most popular apps on the appstore. UserAppStore may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, UserAppStore does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

UserAppStore discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on UserAppStore’s behalf or to provide services available at UserAppStore’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using UserAppStore’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. UserAppStore will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, UserAppStore discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when UserAppStore believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of UserAppStore, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an UserAppStore website and have supplied your email address, UserAppStore may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with UserAppStore and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. UserAppStore takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. UserAppStore uses cookies to help UserAppStore identify and track visitors, their usage of UserAppStore website, and their website access preferences. UserAppStore visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using UserAppStore’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of UserAppStore’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If UserAppStore, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that UserAppStore goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of UserAppStore may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, UserAppStore may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in UserAppStore’s sole discretion. UserAppStore encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
