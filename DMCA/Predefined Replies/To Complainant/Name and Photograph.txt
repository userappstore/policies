Hello,

Some of the material at issue (your name) does not appear to be copyrightable subject matter, and so will not be removed at this time. Please see http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html for more information on this.

Additionally, please note that the subject of a photograph doesnâ€™t necessarily have intellectual property rights in the photograph itself. The owner of the work is generally the photographer or, in certain situations, the employer of the photographer. As such, we do not believe that your complaint properly falls under the DMCA.

You may refer to http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html for more details.

If you still believe that your copyright has been infringed upon (such as if you have had the rights assigned or transferred to you), we ask you to please explain in greater detail why you think this is the case.

You are required to give consideration to whether a use of material is fair before submitting a takedown notification, as a result of the decision in Lenz v. Universal:
