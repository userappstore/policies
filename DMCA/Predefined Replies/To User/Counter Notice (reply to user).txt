Hi,

Your DMCA Counter Notice has been received, reviewed, and forwarded to the claimant. The claimant now has a period of 10 business days to initiate legal action directly against you for the alleged infringement. If no such action is initiated (the claimant has been advised that they must send us any and all relevant documentation regarding any such action), we will restore access to the material in question at the end of the 10 business day period.

Thank you very much.
