Hi there,

As you know, we’ve received several DMCA notices regarding material on your WordPress.com site. Because of these repeat infringements, we’ve had to take the unfortunate action of suspending your site.

If you believe any of the notices were submitted in error, you may wish to submit a counter notice. Please refer to the following for more information or to use our counter notice submission form:

http://en.support.wordpress.com/counter-notice/

Alternatively, if you wish to continue using WordPress for your site, we recommend reviewing whether WordPress.org would be appropriate. You can read more about the self-hosted version of WordPress at http://wordpress.org/ and find a list of our recommended hosts at http://get.wp.com/hosting/.

Please note that other hosts will have similar content policies, and so there is no guarantee that this will prevent your site from being suspended in future elsewhere.

Thank you.
