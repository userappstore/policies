### Terms of Service

### The gist:

We (the [folks at UserAppStore](https://userappstore.com/about/)) run a web app hosting platform called [userappstore.com](https://userappstore.com) and would **love** for you to use it. UserAppStore's basic service is free and private and allows anyone to create projects and web applications. Be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, viruses, pornography, or serious threats of violence) appear on your app. We also have additional services for charging subscription access to your web apps for individuals and teams and maintain a directory of such apps in our app store. If you find a UserAppStore project or something on the app store that you believe violates these Terms of Service, you may [report it](https://userappstore.com/report-app).

### Terms of Service:

The following terms and conditions govern all use of the UserAppStore website and all content, services, and products available at or through the website.

You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these terms will apply to any upgrades. Yur agreement is with UserAppStore Inc. (US), "UserAppStore" or "we". Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access or use any of our services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by UserAppStore, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. Our Services are not directed to children younger than 18, and access and use of our Services is only offered to users 18 years of age or older. If you are under 18 years old, please do not register to use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 18 years of age or older.

#### 1. userappstore.com.

*   **Your userappstore.com Account and Website.** If you create a project or app on userappstore.com, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your project or app, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the app. You must immediately notify UserAppStore of any unauthorized uses of your app, your account, or any other breaches of security. UserAppStore will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
*   **Responsibility of Contributors.** If you post material to userappstore.com, post content on userappstore.com, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, "Content"), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using userappstore.com, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms or the [User Guidelines](https://github.com/userappstore/policies/raw/User-Guidelines.md). By submitting Content to UserAppStore for inclusion on your website, you grant UserAppStore a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your blog. If you delete Content, UserAppStore will use reasonable efforts to remove it from userappstore.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, UserAppStore has the right (though not the obligation) to, in UserAppStore’s sole discretion, (i) refuse or remove any content that, in UserAppStore’s reasonable opinion, violates any UserAppStore policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of developer, app store and publisher facilities to any individual or entity for any reason.

*   **Payment and Renewal.**
    *   **General Terms.** Apps in the app store may charge subscription access.  If you install a subscription app you agree to pay the monthly subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a per-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly subscription period as indicated.  When uninstalling an app refunds are available at your discretion for 7 days after a charge occurs.  UserAppStore may cancel refunds when abuse is detected.
    *   **Automatic Renewal.** Your subscriptions may be recurring until cancellation and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Subscriptions can be canceled at any time in the installed app's configuration or in the manage subscriptions section of the website.

#### 2. Responsibility of Visitors.

UserAppStore has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the web apps and projects posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that app's content, use or effects. By operating our Services, UserAppStore does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Our Services may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. UserAppStore disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of our Services, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.

#### 3. Content Posted on Other Websites.

We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content made available through the websites and webpages to which userappstore.com links, and that link to userappstore.com. UserAppStore does not have any control over those non-UserAppStore websites, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-UserAppStore website, UserAppStore does not represent or imply that it endorses such website. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. UserAppStore disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-UserAppStore websites and webpages.

#### 4. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.

As UserAppStore asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by userappstore.com violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify UserAppStore in accordance with [UserAppStore's Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") Policy](http://automattic.com/dmca-notice/). UserAppStore will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. UserAppStore will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of UserAppStore or others. In the case of such termination, UserAppStore will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to UserAppStore.

#### 5. Intellectual Property.

This Agreement does not transfer from UserAppStore to you any UserAppStore or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with UserAppStore.

We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.

#### 7. Termination.

UserAppStore may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your userappstore.com account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

("JAMS") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules.

These Terms of Service were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms of Service and the English version, the English version will control.

#### 16. Miscellaneous.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between UserAppStore and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of UserAppStore, or by the posting by UserAppStore of a revised version. 

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. 

You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; UserAppStore may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
